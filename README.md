## Reflection

This was another very challenging assignment. It's weird in that, now that I'm mostly done, I see how easy it *could* have been, had I known what I was doing. But I spent so much time with trial and error that it got demoralizing. 

Fortunately, my understanding of routing with mongoose has improved, although only slightly. Since we didn't technically start from scratch, I don't feel like I 100% have mastered routing with mongoose and MongoDB - so those are some potential growth opportunities for the future.
